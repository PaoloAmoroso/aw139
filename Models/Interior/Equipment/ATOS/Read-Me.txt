LEONARDO A.T.O.S. System
=========================
The A.T.O.S. (Airborne Tactical Observation System), according with Leonardo, is an airborne mission management system that integrates a number of sensors and sub-systems to provide full situational awareness and timely decision making.

DISCLAIMER:

This "ATOS System", for security reasons, is not an exact reproduction of the real operational A.T.O.S. System by Leonardo, but an adapted version for a simple use on Flightgear, based on public domain information freely avaiable on internet. Surely is not our intention to disclose any classified information.
This system was developed only for the purpose of increasing, a little, the relism of the simulation, thanks to the author's observations and knowledge of aviation history.

Any reference to a real function, designed by Leonardo, is purely coincidental. The author specifies that this system can be removed from distribution at any time, upon request.

This sistem is, by default, actually limited on a 50 Km range.
